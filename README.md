## Problem statement

AtliQ Mart (Indian FMCG manufacturer) eyes expansion, but faces service hiccups.

Based in Gujarat, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, Vadodra.
Targets metro/tier-1 cities within 2 years.
Recent contract losses due to suspected delivery issues: delays and missing items.
Prior to expansion, management wants improved service for all customers.
Solution: Daily tracking of "On-Time" and "In-Full" delivery metrics.

Standard approach measuring:
- "% On-Time Delivery (OT)"
- "% In-Full Delivery (IF)"
- "% On-Time & In-Full (OTIF)"
Compared against individual customer service level targets.
This approach allows swift response to service problems and prevents them from hindering expansion plans.

Key Highlights:

Focus on service improvement prior to expansion.
Daily tracking of key delivery metrics.
Standardized approach for consistent measurement.
